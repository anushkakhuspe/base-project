# How to use

*Delete this section when you first update this file.*

Whenever you update your project, you should create a new version. And important part of this is documenting changes you have made in a human-readable way. This file provides a convenient place for tracking changes.

See [https://keepachangelog.com/en/](keepachangelog.com) for a good guide on how to write a change log.

Change log entries should have a version number, a date, and subsections detailing changes of each of these types:

* `Added`
* `Changed`
* `Deprecated`
* `Removed`
* `Fixed`
* `Security`
